  <h2>Payment Calculator</h2>
  <p>
      This calculator will tabulate the payments for a new vehicle finance purchase, 
      and/or calculate the loan term and finance interest savings you could realize by making 
      the equivalent of 13 payments per year (bi-weekly) or the equivalent of 14 payments per 
      year (weekly). Weâ€™ve included a payment method comparison chart and a balance comparison 
      chart so you can understand year-by-year impact. The Learn tab below includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Weekly vehicle payments Vs. monthly payments.</li>
    <li>A warning about predatory vehicle finance lenders.</li>
  </ul>

  <ng-template #loanAmount>
      <b>New or original vehicle loan amount:</b>
      <p>If you want to see what the weekly payment would be on a new vehicle loan,
         enter the new car  loan amount. If you have an existing vehicle loan and 
         want to see how much you could save by switching to a bi-weekly or weekly 
         payment, enter the original vehicle loan amount. Enter as a dollar amount 
         without the dollar sign and commas.</p>
  </ng-template>
  <ng-template #interestRate>
      <b>Annual interest rate:</b>
      <p>Enter the annual percentage rate (APR) of the car loan. Enter as a 
        percentage without the percent sign (for 6%, enter 6).</p>
  </ng-template>
  <ng-template #loanTerm>
      <b>Yehicle loan term (in years):</b>
      <p>Enter the term of the new or original car loan in number of years.</p>      
  </ng-template>
  <ng-template #prepaid>
      <b>Number of monthly payments already made:</b>
      <p>If this is an existing vehicle loan, enter the number of monthly payments 
        you have already made. If this is a new vehicle loan, enter a zero or leave blank.</p>      
  </ng-template>
  <ng-template #extraAmount>
      <b>Extra amount you could add to weekly payment (optional):</b>
      <p>If you would like to see how adding an extra weekly amount would affect the 
        payoff time and interest savings, enter the amount here. Note that it may help 
        to calculate the weekly payment amount and savings without an extra payment 
        first, and then if it appears you can afford an extra weekly amount, come 
        back to this field enter the amount you can afford and recalculate.</p>
